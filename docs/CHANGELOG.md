## [1.2.5] - 2025-10-29 - Critical Bug Fix: Page Navigation Callbacks & Page Snap

### Fixed

- **üêõ Page Navigation Callback Issues**
  - Fixed `onPageChanged()` callback not firing after scroll/animation completion
  - Added `loadPageByOffset()` calls in animation completion handlers (`handleAnimationEnd()` and `performFling()`)
  - Ensures page change detection occurs after all navigation operations (scroll, fling, jumpTo, page snap)
  - `onPageChanged()` now fires reliably for all navigation scenarios

- **üìä Page Snap Animation Callbacks**
  - Fixed `onPageScrolled()` reporting intermediate page numbers during page snap animations
  - Added check in `updateScrollUIElements()` to skip callbacks during active page snap animations
  - Prevents confusing page number jumping during snap animations when `pageSnap=true`
  - Page callbacks now only report final settled page positions

- **üéØ Initial Load Page Snapping**
  - Fixed pages not centering with page snap enabled during first load with default page
  - Added `performPageSnap()` calls to `jumpTo()` for non-animated jumps when page snap is enabled
  - Pages now properly center on initial load when `pageSnap=true` configuration is used
  - Improved `loadComplete()` with enhanced logging for debugging initial load issues

- **‚ö° Animation State Detection**
  - Fixed compilation error with incorrect `pdfAnimator.isRunning` property reference
  - Replaced with correct `pdfAnimator.isFlinging` property that checks for active animations
  - Proper detection of page snap animations and flings for callback suppression

### Technical Details

- **Animation Completion Handling**:
  - `PdfAnimator.handleAnimationEnd()` now calls `pdfView.loadPageByOffset()` to detect page changes
  - `PdfAnimator.performFling()` now calls `pdfView.loadPageByOffset()` when fling completes
  - Ensures `onPageChanged()` fires after both programmatic animations and user scroll flings

- **Page Snap Callback Prevention**:
  - `PDFView.updateScrollUIElements()` skips intermediate callbacks when `isPageSnap && pdfAnimator.isFlinging`
  - Prevents page number jumping during snap animations while maintaining final position callbacks
  - Uses consistent page calculation logic across all callback scenarios

- **Initial Load Improvements**:
  - `PDFView.jumpTo()` now performs page snapping for non-animated jumps when page snap is enabled
  - Enhanced `loadComplete()` with better logging for initial page jump operations
  - Proper initialization sequence ensures page centering on document load

### Migration Guide

No code changes required. This is an internal bug fix that improves callback reliability and page snap behavior.

**What's Fixed:**

```kotlin
// Page change callbacks now work correctly in all scenarios
pdfView.configureView {
    pageSnap(true)
    pageNavigationEventListener(object : PageNavigationEventListener {
        override fun onPageChanged(page: Int, pageCount: Int) {
            // ‚úÖ NOW FIRES: After scroll completion
            // ‚úÖ NOW FIRES: After animation completion  
            // ‚úÖ NOW FIRES: After page snap settles
        }
        
        override fun onPageScrolled(page: Int, positionOffset: Float) {
            // ‚úÖ NO MORE JUMPING: Stable page numbers during snap animations
            // ‚úÖ ACCURATE: Reports correct page during scroll
        }
    })
}
```

**Root Cause:**

- Animation completion didn't trigger page change detection
- Page snap animations caused intermediate callback reports
- Initial load timing issues prevented proper page positioning
- Missing `loadPageByOffset()` calls in animation end handlers

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.rhariskumar3:pdfpreview:1.2.5'
}
```

## [1.2.4] - 2025-10-28 - Critical Bug Fix: Page Calculation Accuracy with Page Snap

### Fixed

- **üêõ Page Snap Callback Inaccuracy**
  - Fixed `onPageScrolled()` reporting incorrect page numbers during page snap animations
  - Updated `updateScrollUIElements()` to use screen-center-based page calculation instead of positionOffset conversion
  - Now uses identical page detection logic as `loadPageByOffset()` for consistent results
  - Eliminates page number jumping during scroll deceleration and snap animations

- **üìä Accurate Page Position Tracking**
  - Page calculations now account for viewport size and screen center positioning
  - Fixed floating-point precision errors in page offset calculations
  - Consistent page detection across scroll gestures, animations, and callbacks
  - Improved reliability with `pageSnap=true` configuration

### Technical Details

- **Page Calculation Algorithm Fix**:
  - Changed from `getPageAtPositionOffset(positionOffset)` to direct screen-center calculation
  - Uses `-(currentYOffset - height/2)` for vertical scrolling, `-(currentXOffset - width/2)` for horizontal
  - Matches the exact logic used in `loadPageByOffset()` for page change detection
  - Eliminates discrepancies between scroll callbacks and actual page changes

- **Page Snap Compatibility**:
  - Fixed callback accuracy when `pageSnap=true` is enabled
  - Page numbers remain stable during snap animations
  - No more incorrect page reporting during scroll deceleration

### Migration Guide

No code changes required. This is an internal bug fix that improves callback accuracy.

**What's Fixed:**

```kotlin
// With pageSnap=true, this now reports accurate page numbers
pdfView.configureView {
    pageSnap(true)
    pageNavigationEventListener(object : PageNavigationEventListener {
        override fun onPageScrolled(page: Int, positionOffset: Float) {
            // ‚úÖ NOW ACCURATE: No more jumping between wrong page numbers
            // ‚úÖ STABLE: Consistent page numbers during snap animations
        }
    })
}
```

**Root Cause:**

- `positionOffset` conversion (`docLen * positionOffset`) didn't account for viewport size
- Screen-center calculation (`-(offset - screenCenter)`) provides accurate page detection
- Inconsistent algorithms caused callback/page change detection mismatch

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.rhariskumar3:pdfpreview:1.2.4'
}
```

## [1.2.3] - 2025-10-28 - Critical Bug Fix: Page Navigation Callbacks

### Fixed

- **üêõ Page Change Callback Bug**
  - Fixed `onPageChanged()` callback not firing after manual scroll stops
  - Added missing `loadPageByOffset()` call in `onScrollEnd()` method
  - Now correctly detects page changes after user scroll gestures complete
  - `onPageChanged()` now fires reliably for both `jumpTo()` and manual scroll scenarios

- **üìä Page Scrolled Callback Accuracy**
  - Fixed `onPageScrolled()` reporting incorrect page numbers during scroll
  - Updated `updateScrollUIElements()` to use `actualCurrentPage` calculated from `positionOffset`
  - Separated logic for `documentFitsView` scenarios to prevent invalid page calculations
  - More accurate page position tracking during continuous scroll gestures

- **‚ö° Redundant Load Optimization**
  - Removed duplicate `loadPages()` call in `onScrollEnd()`
  - `loadPageByOffset()` now handles page detection and tile loading internally
  - Reduced unnecessary tile regeneration after scroll completion

### Technical Details

- **Callback Sequence Fix**:
  - `onScrollEnd()` now calls `loadPageByOffset()` which triggers `showPage()` if page changed
  - `showPage()` updates `currentPage` and fires `onPageChanged(page, pageCount)` callback
  - Ensures callbacks fire consistently across all navigation methods

- **Page Calculation Improvements**:
  - `actualCurrentPage` now correctly calculated from scroll position during `onPageScrolled()`
  - Prevents floating-point errors in multi-page scenarios
  - Handles single-page documents correctly without invalid page numbers

### Migration Guide

No code changes required. These are internal bug fixes that improve callback reliability.

**What's Fixed:**

```kotlin
// This now works correctly - onPageChanged fires when user stops scrolling
pdfView.configureView {
    pageNavigationEventListener(object : PageNavigationEventListener {
        override fun onPageChanged(page: Int, pageCount: Int) {
            // ‚úÖ NOW FIRES: After manual scroll stops on new page
            // ‚úÖ STILL FIRES: After jumpTo() navigation
            // ‚úÖ STILL FIRES: After scroll handle drag
        }
        
        override fun onPageScrolled(page: Int, positionOffset: Float) {
            // ‚úÖ NOW ACCURATE: Reports correct page number during scroll
        }
    })
}
```

**Affected Components:**

- `DragPinchManager.onScrollEnd()` - Added page change detection
- `PDFView.updateScrollUIElements()` - Fixed page calculation for callbacks
- `PDFView.loadPageByOffset()` - Now integrated into scroll end flow

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.rhariskumar3:pdfpreview:1.2.3'
}
```
