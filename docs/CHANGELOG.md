## [1.1.0] - 2025-09-03 - Major Architecture Refactor

### Added

- **üèóÔ∏è New Separated Configuration Architecture**
    - `PdfViewConfiguration` class for factory-time settings (view behavior, rendering, listeners)
    - `PdfLoadRequest` class for runtime settings (document source, password, page selection)
    - `PDFView.configure(PdfViewConfiguration)` method for applying view configuration
    - `PDFView.load(PdfLoadRequest)` method for loading documents with runtime settings
    - Extension methods `PdfRequest.toViewConfiguration()` and `PdfRequest.toLoadRequest()` for
      migration

- **üîê Enhanced Password Management**
    - Runtime password updates without losing view state
    - Easy password retry scenarios with `PdfLoadRequest.copy(password = newPassword)`
    - Support for document switching while preserving passwords

- **‚ö° Performance Improvements**
    - Factory-time configuration cached and reused across document loads
    - Reduced object allocation for repeated document operations
    - Optimized memory usage with clear separation of concerns

- **üéØ Jetpack Compose Integration**
    - Natural support for AndroidView factory/update pattern
    - Proper recomposition handling with separated configuration
    - Document switching without view reconfiguration

- **üõ†Ô∏è DSL Extension Functions**
    - `configureView { }` extension for PDFView configuration
    - `loadDocument { }` extension for document loading
    - Fluent builder API for improved developer experience

- **üìã Builder Pattern Support**
    - `PdfViewConfiguration.Builder` for programmatic configuration

    - `Use_Case_Implementations.md` - Practical implementation scenarios and patterns

### Changed

- **üìã API Evolution**
    - `PdfRequest` and `PDFView.enqueue()` method marked as deprecated (but fully supported)
    - Improved error handling with clearer exception paths
    - Better separation between factory-time and runtime concerns

- **üîß Internal Architecture Improvements**
    - Deferred PDF loading until view dimensions are available (prevents loading with invalid size)
    - Enhanced logging in `jumpTo` method for better debugging of page navigation issues
    - Added null safety checks in `showPage` method to prevent NullPointerExceptions

### Deprecated

- `PdfRequest` class - Use `PdfViewConfiguration` + `PdfLoadRequest` instead
- `PDFView.enqueue(PdfRequest)` method - Use `configure()` + `load()` pattern instead
- Migration path provided with clear deprecation warnings and `ReplaceWith` annotations

### Migration Guide

#### From Old API to New API:

```kotlin
// OLD (deprecated but still works)
val request = PdfRequest.Builder(source)
    .swipeHorizontal(true)
    .password("password")
    .defaultPage(1)
    .documentLoadListener(...)
.build()
pdfView.enqueue(request)

// NEW (recommended DSL approach)
pdfView.configureView {
    swipeHorizontal(true)
    documentLoadListener(...)
}
pdfView.loadDocument(source) {
    password("password")
    defaultPage(1)
}
```

```

#### Automatic Migration Helper:

```kotlin
// Quick migration using extension methods
val oldRequest = PdfRequest.Builder(source)...build()
pdfView.configure(oldRequest.toViewConfiguration())
pdfView.load(oldRequest.toLoadRequest())
```

#### Password Retry Example:

```kotlin
// NEW - Easy password retry with DSL
pdfView.loadDocument(file) {
    password("new_password")
}

// OLD - Complex recreation required
val newRequest = PdfRequest.Builder(source).password("new_password")...build()
pdfView.enqueue(newRequest)
```

### Benefits of New Architecture

- **üîÑ Runtime Updates**: Change password, document, or pages without view reconfiguration
- **üè≠ Factory Pattern**: Matches Android/Compose best practices with clear separation
- **üíæ Memory Efficient**: View configuration set once, only document data changes
